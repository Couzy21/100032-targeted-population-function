   Collection name : Name of the Collection in selected database name	
   Field name of the event ID/Primary field :Name of the field of event ID based on which event IDs to be fetched(from event function)
   type of event : what kind of data is there like learning,testing,etc(from event function)
   distribution : type of distribution to be selected based on which data to be fetched.
           i) Normal distribution = 1,  if selected 
                                    0,  if not selected
           ii) Poisson distribution = 1,  if selected 
                                    0,  if not selected   
           iii) Binomial distribution = 1,  if selected 
                                     0,  if not selected
           iv) Bernoulli distribution = 1,  if selected

   period	: time period for which data to be fetched like last one day, last one hour, lifetime,custom,etc
   start point : if custom period is selected, from where to start.
   end point:  if custom period is selected, till where to continue.
   maximum point: it is the value which is maximum for sum of data 
   Pop Avg : data to be fetched in such a way it should be unbiased estimate of pop avg
   range: if the selected data to be divided in some ranges for additional reqirement
   number of units: no of units to be selected in the range defined above
   first position:for random lot, from where to start the selection
   last position : for random lot, till where to fetch

   lot size:size of random lot
   error: alowable error in %
   splits : based on which data is splited based on distributions
   
   OUTPUT VARIABLE :
   required data : the required data as per the distribution ,period and primary field.
   adequacy status :whether the data obtained is adequate or not as per sampling rules.
   event ID: returned from event function and fetched event Ids too along with data
   Process time: time taken to get the output
   size : size of the final output
