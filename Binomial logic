start								
	continuing after fetching data from db using event function( 1 April to 30 April)							
	define Number of variables allowed as variable "N"							
		Input from user or frontend programmer						
	define split as variable "S"							
		Input from user or frontend programmer						
	if d=1,							
		input N						
		fetch data from the selected primary field which counts to N						
		input S						
			"calculated" or "simple"					
		if simple splits is selected						
			make splits based on N				splits dynamically or equal	
			count the number of splits obtained				accuracy wise	input directly
		if calculated splits is selected,						
			Calculate n using slovin's formula for margin of error "e"					
				make splits based on n				
				count the number of splits obtained				
Note:	eliminate last split if it is not =N,or check accuracy							
		if last split size is not equals to N						
			Display list to user containing " eliminate or check accuracy"					
		if "eliminate" is selected,						
			then eliminate the last split					
		if "check accuracy" is selected,						
			 define allowable error as variable "E"					
				Input from user or frontend programmer				
					check if last split size is lying within (N - EN,N+EN)		(E is in %)	
						if yes, then consider the split		
						otherwise eliminate		
								
		define the condition for success						
			Input from user or frontend programmer			equal,less than,greater than		
				display a list of options to user for defining the condition for success "less than, greater than,equal to,less than equal to,greater than equals to"				
					selection from above list by  user or frontend programmer			
				if less than is selected,				
					define "s" as variable			
						Input from user or frontend programmer		
					input value of "s" (atleast greater than the minimum value of the data given"			
				if greater than is selected,				
					define "s" as variable			
						Input from user or frontend programmer		
					input value of "s" (atleast less than the maximum value of the data given"			
				if equals to is selected,				
					check data is having numbers or attributes			
						if numbers,then input s= number		
						if attribute,then input s= attribute 		
			note:	similarly for other two				
								
			check the fetched data in each split according to the condition					
				mark each data value as success or failure				
				count number of successes in each split				
			call dowelleventcreation()					
								
		function output(event id,data,no of successes,splits,s)
